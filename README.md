Documentation for the HRM
=========================

This repository contains the sources of the [sphinx-based][1] documentation for the [Huygens Remote Manager][2]. It consists of two parts:

* the admin instructions (in `docs/admin`)
* the user manual (in `docs/user`)

The compiled documentation is available on [readthedocs.org][3] as HTML, PDF and Epub.

Editing conventions
===================

1.- When creating HRM screenshots log on to HRM with the user 'hrm', then
capture the screenshot. This way all the HRM screenshots in the manual will
display the same user.

2.- Save image as .PNG. Currently there are many .gif which are only meant as
a guide. Gif images will be replaced by png's.

Building the documentation using a local sphinx readthedocs (RTD) theme
=======================================================================

Sphinx Installation
-------------------

Install the Sphinx Python documentation generator (preferably in a separate *virtual
environment*, see the Python documentation for details):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Building the docs
-----------------

Set the environment variable `USE_LOCAL_SPHINX_RTD_THEME` to enable the
local sphinx_rtd_theme. You can set it in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` or define
it right before use:

```bash
cd docs/
export USE_LOCAL_SPHINX_RTD_THEME=1
make html
```

The configuration file `conf.py` will fall back to the default theme if sphinx_rtd_theme
is not found.
