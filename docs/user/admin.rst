*************************
Administration of the HRM
*************************

HRM consists of two main components: a **web based interface** and a **queue
manager**.

The **web interface** allows:

*  the management of users by the system administrator;
*  the management of parameter sets (templates) that all users can copy or use
   directly;
*  the creation of deconvolution jobs, including image selection,
   setting microscopic, restoration and analysis parameters;
*  inspecting the job queue status, and allowing the users to delete
   their own jobs from it;
*  previewing and analyzing deconvolved images, including a slicer,
   MIP and SFP renderers, movies and colocalization results;
*  sharing templates among users;
*  visualizing user and jobs statistics.

HRM is equipped with a simple `http` file uploader/downloader to send raw
images from the user’s local machine to the HRM server, as well as to
retrieve the deconvolution results from the server. The server administrator
can set up a limit for these transactions.

The **queue manager**, running the background, dispatches:

* the jobs created via the web interface to any of the dedicated servers
  running Huygens Core.
* the emails to inform the users that the job is finished and that the
  restored datasets are available.


Installation and requirements
=============================

To install HRM the following pre-requisites (at least) must be fulfilled:

* **Operating system**: Any recent Linux distribution. Based on Debian or
  RHEL.
* **Huygens Core**: HRM is just an interface and needs Huygens Core to
  perform deconvolution on the raw images. Note that Huygens Core needs a
  license.
* **Apache2 web server**.
* **PHP version** |ge| **5.6**:
  Both the HRM queue manager and the web interface are written in PHP and need
  PHP to operate.
* **MySQL or PostgreSQL**:
  A relational database management system is required to store deconvolution
  parameters, job descriptions and, optionally, user accounts.
* **A file server**: To temporarily store input and restored datasets.


The setup is **highly configurable**, since the file server, the processing
servers and the queue manager can either be all hosted by the same
machine or be distributed across two, three or more computers.

To follow the steps for a guided installation please see `the installation
page at the HRM project’s site <http://huygens-remote-manager.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_. 


Administrator’s options
=======================

Log in to HRM with the credentials of the administrator. Instead of the
regular user home panel HRM will display the administrator home panel, like
this:

|AdminHomePanelScreenshot|

There are a number of extra options that are available to the administrator
only:

* **Manage users**: Add, remove, edit, enable and disable
  users. Alternatively, HRM allows for LDAP/Active Directory user management.

* **Queue status**: Manage jobs from **all** users.

* **Global statistics**: See statistics from all users and jobs, including
  microscope types, PSFs, research groups, dates, etc.

* **Database update**: Carry out a database update when a new HRM release
  requires it.

* **System summary**: Get an overview of all the versions and configuration
  options that play a role in HRM.

* **Check for updates**: Get automatic feedback on whether you are running
  the latest HRM version.
  
* **Create global templates**: The administrator can create global templates
  accessible to all users. This is meaningful for lowering the threshold
  for those beginning users who need assistance to start deconvolving their
  raw data. Global templates can be created at any of the states where
  templates are required: :ref:`decon_job_step2`, :ref:`decon_job_step3` and :ref:`decon_job_step3`.

* **Servers & GPUs**: Add and remove processing machines and GPU cards. This
  has an effect on the total number of jobs that can run in parallel.

* **HuCore licenses**: Get an overview of the installed Huygens license. 


Version upgrade
===============

.. note:: Before upgrading HRM please proceed to **backup** the HRM database,
          images and source files.

To upgrade to a new version, download the latest version `from here
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/hrm/files/latest/download>`_. Then follow the
intructions on `specific version upgrades <http://huygens-remote-manager.readthedocs.org/en/latest/admin/upgrade.html>`_.


Database update
===============

.. note:: The HRM database should **NOT** be deleted and replaced by a newer
          version.

The HRM database contains the existing users, statistics, parameter
templates, etc. To update these contents to the latest release click on
`Database Update` |UpdateDB22x22| from the admin
home panel and follow the instructions.

In order for this update to work properly it is advised to upgrade the
HRM source code before upgrading the database.


System configuration
====================

HRM can be configured during the installation. The configuration settings
are saved in a configuration file. Some settings, as the maximum
upload limit, need to be adjusted both in HRM and in PHP.

For example, if the PHP configuration file states a max upload file size of
256MB, this is applicable to all programs using PHP. Suppose the HRM
settings state that the max upload limit is 200MB, since 200MB is
lower than 256MB, the HRM configuration does not conflict with the PHP
configuration and 200MB is the maximum allowed file size.

.. note::
   
   **The PHP configuration file**: /path/to/php/php.ini
   
   **The HRM configuration file**: /path/to/hrm/config/hrm_config.inc


How HRM communicates with Huygens Core
======================================

For each deconvolution task in the job queue the HRM queue manager
automatically generates a Huygens Batch template for Huygens Core that

-  loads the raw image from a source directory,
-  applies the microscopic parameters to it as defined by the user or
   reads the microscopic parameters from the image metadata,
-  optionally loads another image containing the microscope Point Spread
   Function,
-  deconvolves the image using the restoration parameters chosen by the
   user,
-  optionally applies a chromatic aberration correction,
-  optionally stabilizes the time series,
-  optionally computes the colocalization coefficients of multi-channel images
   and generates colocalization maps,
-  stores the resulting restored image in a destination directory,
-  generates several visualizations of the raw and deconvolved
   images for the user to see the effect of the restoration,
-  and finally writes a tag in the destination directory to inform the
   HRM queue manager that the job is finished.

When the job is finished the queue manager optionally sends the user an
e-mail announcing the end of the job and its status. The administrator
may configure this.

Multiple jobs can be processed in parallel depending on how HRM is
configured, the multiprocessing capabilities of the server, the
number of available computation servers and GPU cards.


Tips & Tricks
=============

* Use the global statistics to get an idea on which microscopes are used most,
  which file formats, PSFs, etc.

* On the home panel, click on `System summary` |SystemSummary22x22| to get an
  overview of your current HRM settings. Expand this information with the
  PHP settings and/or test the HRM e-mails by clicking on |LightBulb18x22|.

* When performing an HRM upgrade disable all users first. Upon successfully
  upgrading HRM enable the users back again.

* If you experience unexpected behaviour from the HRM queue manager, such as
  a deleted job which persists in the queue, restart the HRM daemon.

* Encourage your users to save deconvolved data in ICS or HDF5 formats since
  the dynamic range and metadata parameters are conserved (unlike in TIFF).
  Moreover both ICS and HDF5 allow for good compression rates. 

Clean a Stalled Queue in HRM
============================

It could happen that the queue breaks or freezes and the database is polluted with outdated information.

To fix this, one must currently go and clean up a few places in the hrm database as well as restart the queue manager. Here is a short checklist of what to do.

1. shut down the hrm daemon by using

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd stop
       
or 

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo systemctl stop hrmd


2. go to the ``hrm`` database and do the following

   a. Remove broken or killed jobs from the ``job_*`` tables
   b. Make sure that the ``server`` table has a *status* of 'free' and *job* set to NULL

   Both measures can be achieved with the following SQL script:
      
.. code-block:: sql

   DELETE FROM job_analysis_parameter WHERE setting IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");   
   DELETE FROM job_analysis_setting WHERE name IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_files WHERE job IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_parameter WHERE setting IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_parameter_setting WHERE name IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_task_parameter WHERE setting IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_task_setting WHERE name IN (SELECT id FROM job_queue WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill");
   DELETE FROM job_queue  WHERE status="broken" OR status="kill";
   UPDATE server SET status= 'free', job = NULL;

3. restart the hrm daemon

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd start
