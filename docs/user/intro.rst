Introduction
************

The HRM is a collaborative open-source interface to Huygens Core for
multi-user, web-based, scheduled, batch deconvolution.

The Huygens Remote Manager (HRM) enables large groups of users to work with
Huygens on a central system through an easy-to-use interface.
HRM is web-based and therefore easily accessible from your workstation, home
PC, tablet or smart phone.

An HRM server can distribute work among several processing machines smartly,
which allows for intelligent use of hardware and fast processing times. It
features an intelligent queue that switches among the jobs of all users.

  Institute (FMI, Basel),
* The BioImaging and Optics Platform at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de
  Lausanne,
* The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH Zürich,
* The Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology (Magdeburg),
* The Combinatorial Neuroimaging facility (Magdeburg),
* The Imaging Core Facility at the Biozentrum (University of Basel).
* The University of Fribourg.
* The Microscopy and Image Analysis Platform of the University of Freiburg.
* The University of Manchester.
  
Scientific Volume Imaging participates in this project by contributing
its experience in deconvolution and software engineering.
