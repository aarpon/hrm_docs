Results - detailed view
***********************

When the job finishes, the files are placed in the |Results22x22|  **Results**
folder, accessible via the home panel.

Click on an image result for further inspection as explained in
:ref:`results` .
     
The detailed view shows the following information:

* `MIP <http://www.svi.nl/MIP>`_ of **original** vs **deconvolved**,
* `SFP <http://www.svi.nl/SFP>`_    of **original** vs **deconvolved**,
* Z Slicer of **original** vs **deconvolved**,
* T Slicer of **original** vs **deconvolved**,
* Stack movie of **deconvolved**,
* T movie of **deconvolved**,
* T SFP movie of **deconvolved**,
* Colocalization results,
* Parameter summaries,
* Huygens log.

.. note:: The number of tools shown in the detailed view depends on the type
          of restoration, the image geometry and the HRM configuration.

  
Comparing MIPs
==============

A comparison of the Maximum Intensity Projections of the raw image and the
restored image shows the effect of deconvolution. This can be assessed in both
XY and XZ projections.

Comparing SFPs
==============

A comparison of the `Simulated Fluoresence Process <http://www.svi.nl/SFP>`_
in both the raw image and the restored image also shows the effect of
deconvolution and difference in noise.

Comparing Z Slices
==================

The slicer allows for a comparision of the raw image and the restored image
slice by slice along the Z direction at any depth.

Comparing T frames
==================

The time slicer allows for a comparision of the raw image and the restored image
frame by frame.

Z, T and T-SFP movies
=====================

Click on the corresponding links to download any of the movies to your local
computer.

.. note:: These automatically made movies are quite useful for
          prepraring presentations. 


.. _colocalisation_results:

Colocalization
==============

The selected colocalization coefficients of each two channels are listed
in a table with an entry per frame.

|ColocTableScreenshot|

Also, `2D histograms <http://www.svi.nl/2DHistogram>`_ show the correlations
between any two channels.

Lastly, the colocalization maps show the regions where colocalization between
any two channels is strongest.

.. _parameter_summaries:

Parameter summaries
===================

HRM also gives feedback on all the parameter values used during deconvolution.
This is particularly useful when the parameters are read from the image
metadata. 

|ParameterSummaryScreenshot|

Notice that green entries indicate parameters loaded from the image metadata,
whereas violet entries indicate parameters defined by the user.

If the image had to be scaled to fit in the output file format (some formats
have very limited dynamic ranges) HRM will show the scaling factors for
further quantification:

Huygens log
===========

The exact steps followed by Huygens to process the data can be found on the
Huygens log, under the link |HuygensLogLink| .


.. note:: All these results can be **donwloaded** along with the deconvolved
          dataset by clicking |DownloadResults22x22| at the top of the page.
