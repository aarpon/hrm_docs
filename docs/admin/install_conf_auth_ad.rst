Special case: Active Directory forests
======================================

.. warning::

    For most installations, you can skip the entire rest of this section and
    proceed with the next one by simply leaving the variables
    ``$AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX``, ``$AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX_REPLACE_MATCH`` and
    ``$AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX_REPLACE_STRING`` with their default values (empty,
    i.e. ``""``).

This part of the config is meant for the special case of an Active Directory
with multiple domains (commonly referred to as `forest`) which usually consist
of a top-level domain (the `forest root` domain) and several sub-domains. If
the HRM users belong to domains in all levels of the forest it would be
required to enter the full domain name for logging in, which can become quite
tedious (and therefore error-prone).

Consider the following domain setup, a root domain called ``SATURN`` with two
sub-domains ``RHEA`` and ``TETHYS``. Those "plain" domain names are usually
referred to as `NetBIOS Domain Names`. A hierarchical representation could look
like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    SATURN
      |
      +-- RHEA
      |
      +-- TETHYS

Now, assuming a top-level suffix of ``.private``, in Microsoft's Active
Directory naming scheme this is translated into fully qualified domain names
(FQDN's) as follows. The `root` domain (SATURN) gets prefixed by ``ads.`` and
followed by the top-level ``.private`` suffix, whereas the two subdomains just
get postfixed by the FQDN of the root domain. The graphical representation from
above would therefore translate into this:

.. code-block:: sh

    ads.saturn.private
      |
      +-- rhea.ads.saturn.private
      |
      +-- tethys.ads.saturn.private


To make authentication work in such a scenario, it is required to authenticate
against the `GLOBAL CATALOG` of the Active Directory. This is an LDAP service
provided `only` on the domain controllers of the `root` domain on the special
port ``3268``. The usernames used to authenticate have to be of the form
``username@fully.qualified.domain.name`` to provide the global catalog with the
information to which sub-domain a certain account belongs as it is possible to
have the same username for different accounts in different domains of a single
domain forest.

Now given the HRM configuration option ``$ACCOUNT_SUFFIX`` would be set to
``.saturn.private``, a user ``foo`` from the domain ``SATURN`` could log in
using something like ``foo@ads`` whereas a user ``bar`` from ``RHEA`` would
have to type ``bar@rhea.ads``. This is obviously screaming for problems as
normal users don't understand where and why to put those weird suffixes,
especially as they've never heard of something like ``ads`` before.

Using the sample config from below, users can simply log on by using their
regular account name followed by an ``@`` sign and the (short) NetBIOS domain
name, e.g.

    `foo@saturn`

or

    `bar@rhea`

which is way easier to explain and remember for them, especially as the short
domain names are usually visible for them when logging into their workstation.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    ...
    $ACCOUNT_SUFFIX = "";
    $BASE_DN = "DC=ads, DC=saturn, DC=private";

    // set this to a domain controller of the *ROOT* domain:
    $DOMAIN_CONTROLLERS = array("dc01.ads.saturn.private");

    // the port is required to connect to the global catalog:
    $AD_PORT = 3268;

    // give the FQDN of the root domain with a leading dot here:
    $AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX = ".ads.saturn.private";

    // account names from the root domain will end up wrong, looking like this
    // (note the leading "@" and the double occurence of the root domain):
    $AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX_REPLACE_MATCH = "@saturn.ads.saturn.private";

    // they have to be rewritten using the correct suffix instead (removing the
    // first occurence of the root domain name):
    $AD_USERNAME_SUFFIX_REPLACE_STRING = "@ads.saturn.private";
    ?>

Please feel free to contact the HRM developers in case you need help setting up
authentication in a multi-domain forest scenario!



TLS Configurations
==================

To secure the connection between the HRM server and the LDAP server, it is recommended to enable the
transport layer security (TLS). Once the LDAP authentication described in the previous section works,
We need to do the modifications bellow to encrypt the communication between our servers.

First we need to edit the ``/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`` and add the following line in the file:

.. code-block:: bash

    TLS_REQCERT never


Then in ``$HRM_CONFIG/active_directory_config.inc`` change the following lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    $AD_PORT = 636;
    $USE_SSL = true;


Testing and Debugging
=====================

To test if the *base_DN* and *search_DN* work as well as for testing the TLS configurations,
there is a helper script in ``$HRM_HOME/resources/debugActiveDirectory.php``. Before testing this script needs editing to assign to the ``$query_u`` variable a meaningful user name.
Then the ``$HRM_HOME/resources`` directory it can by directly executed with the following command.


.. code-block:: bash

    php debugActiveDirectory.php

This will generate some useful output to help troubleshooting connection and query problems.
