HRM daemon with System-V-like init systems
==========================================

.. warning::

    Please make sure to only follow **EITHER** the instructions given in this
    chapter here for installing the daemon on ``System-V`` or ``upstart`` based
    systems, **OR** the ones for :ref:`systemd <install_hrmd_systemd>`, but
    **NEVER BOTH**.

    If unsure, use the instructions here!

Install the init script
-----------------------

To launch the HRM daemon at boot, we are providing an init script in
``$HRM_RESRC/sysv-init-lsb/hrmd`` which can be placed in ``/etc/init.d/``. The
script makes use of the LSB init functions and therefore requires
``/lib/lsb/init-functions`` to be available in your distribution (which is true
for Ubuntu and RHEL systems, as well as most other major up-to-date Linux
distributions).

For installing the init script, type the following commands in a shell:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo cp -v $HRM_RESRC/sysv-init-lsb/hrmd /etc/init.d/hrmd
    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/hrmd

Start / stop the daemon at boot / shutdown
--------------------------------------------

|ubuntu| Ubuntu: To set up the appropriate run-level links for starting and
stopping the daemon during boot and shutdown, use this command:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo update-rc.d hrmd defaults

This will configure your system to run the init script in the default
run-levels. Please note that issuing this command does *NOT* actually start the
daemon until the next reboot. To start it right now follow the steps in the
section below.

**RHEL**

Recent versions of RHEL-based sysmtems do not install the Linux Standard
Base (LSB)
specification by default, as they are using ``systemd`` init. Therefore we
recommend using the systemd unit file, described in :ref:`install_hrmd_systemd`.

.. note:: If you want to use the classical init script approach nevertheless,
          please make sure the package ``redhat-lsb.x86_64`` is installed, i.e.
          by running:

          .. code-block:: sh

              sudo dnf install redhat-lsb.x86_64

Start manually
--------------

Make sure to set the proper value of ``SUSER`` in ``/etc/hrm.conf`` (see :ref:`configure_hrm`).

Start a shell and type:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd start

If the queue manager started correctly, you should see:

.. code-block:: sh

    Forking background process...
    Reporting stdout to '/var/log/hrm/log.txt' and stderr to '/var/log/hrm/error_log.txt'.

To check if the queue manager daemon is running, use the ``status`` argument.
In case the service is operational, it will show a message like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    [ ok ] HRM is running (/var/www/hrm/bin/hrm_queuemanager), PID: 1234.

The queue manager can be started, stopped and restarted by using:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd start
    sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/hrmd restart
